Exquisite Corpse

Exquisite corpse is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. 
Exquisite corpse is meant to be played with multiple people with each collaborator contributing 
to a story, picture, or other work.

Rules:
1)	Any coder who would like to play this game must first make a branch or fork of the current state of
	the game.
2)	Do not read story.txt until your have made your contribution.
3)	Open nextLine.txt, read the sentence, and then continue the story by adding another 
	sentence below it.
4)	Take the sentence that was in nextLine.txt (not the one your wrote) delete it from nextLine.txt
	and add it to the end of story.txt. nextLine.txt should now only have the sentence you just added.
5)	Read story.txt so far.
